# NMOS Driver Resistive-Load OR Gate  

Designed and simulated a **two-input OR gate** using a **resistive-load NMOS architecture** in **Cadence Virtuoso** and **Microwind**.

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the working of an OR logic gate implemented using NMOS transistors with a resistive load.  
The design was verified through schematic, layout, and transient simulations to evaluate propagation delay and logic behavior.

### 🧩 Key Features
- Implemented using **resistive-load NMOS configuration**
- Simulated at **90 nm technology node**
- Achieved propagation delay ≈ **2 ns**
- Tools used: **Cadence Virtuoso**, **Microwind**

## 🧠 Circuit Details
- Two NMOS transistors act as pull-down devices (series driver configuration)
- A resistive load provides pull-up to VDD
- Output verified using transient and DC transfer simulations

## 📊 Results
| Parameter | Value |
|------------|--------|
| Supply Voltage (VDD) | 1.2 V |
| Technology Node | 90 nm |
| Propagation Delay | ≈ 2 ns |
| Load Resistance | Tuned for target delay |
